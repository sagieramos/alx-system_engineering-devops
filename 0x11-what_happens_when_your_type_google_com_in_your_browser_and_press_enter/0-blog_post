When you type "https://www.google.com" into your browser and press Enter, a series of events occur that ultimately result in the Google homepage being displayed on your screen.

First, your browser sends a request to the domain name system (DNS) server, which is responsible for converting human-readable domain names (like "google.com") into the IP addresses that computers use to communicate with each other. The DNS server looks up the IP address for "google.com" and sends it back to your browser.

Once the browser has received the IP address, it uses the TCP/IP protocol to establish a connection with the Google server. Firewalls may be in place to control the incoming and outgoing traffic to the server.

Next, the browser establishes a secure connection with the server using HTTPS/SSL (or TLS). This process, known as the SSL Handshake, verifies the identity of the server and encrypts the data being transmitted.

Once the secure connection is established, the browser sends an HTTP GET request to the Google server, asking it to send the homepage HTML file. The request is then passed through a load balancer which distributes the traffic among multiple servers.

The request is then handled by the web server, which may also forward it to an application server (like Apache Tomcat) that handles more complex logic. The application server may then query a database to retrieve any necessary data before sending back the HTML file.

Finally, the browser receives the HTML file, renders it, and displays the Google homepage on your screen, complete with images, text, and links. This entire process happens quickly, often in less than a second, making it seem almost instantaneous to the user.

Typing "https://www.google.com" into the browser and pressing Enter sets off a sequence of steps which include:

DNS resolution, 
TCP/IP connection, 
firewall, 
HTTPS/SSL, 
load-balancer, 
web server, 
application server and 
database, 

The above process result in the Google homepage being displayed on your screen.
